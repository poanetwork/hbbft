//! # Broadcast
//!
//! The Broadcast Protocol assumes a network of _N_ validators that send signed messages to
//! each other, with at most _f_ of them faulty, where _3 f < N_. It allows one validator, the
//! "proposer", to send a value to the other validators, and guarantees that:
//! * If the proposer is correct, all correct validators will receive the value.
//! * If the proposer is faulty, either all correct validators will receive the same value, or none
//! of them receives any value at all.
//!
//! Handling the networking and signing is the responsibility of this crate's user:
//! * The proposer needs to be determined beforehand. In all nodes, `Broadcast::new` must be called
//! with the same proposer's ID.
//! * Only in the proposer, `Broadcast::broadcast` is called, with the value they want to send.
//! * All messages contained in `Step`s returned by any of the methods must be securely sent to the
//! other nodes, e.g. by signing, (possibly encrypting) and sending them over the network.
//! * All incoming, verified messages must be passed into `Broadcast::handle_message`. It is the
//! user's responsibility to validate the sender, e.g. by checking the signature.
//! * Eventually, a `Step` will contain the value as its output. At that point, the algorithm has
//! terminated and the instance can be dropped. (The messages in the last step still need to be
//! sent out, though, to allow the other nodes to terminate, too.)
//!
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! The proposer uses a Reed-Solomon code to split the value into _N_ chunks, _N - 2 f_ of which
//! suffice to reconstruct the value. These chunks `s[0]`, `s[1]`, ..., `s[N - 1]` are used as the
//! leaves of a Merkle tree, a data structure which allows creating small proofs that the chunks
//! belong together: The tree has a root hash `h`, and for each chunk `s[i]`, there is a branch
//! `b[i]` connecting that chunk to the root hash. Together, these values are the proof
//! `p[i] = (h, b[i], s[i])`, with which a third party can verify that `s[i]` is the `i`-th leaf of
//! the Merkle tree with root hash `h`.
//!
//! The algorithm proceeds as follows:
//! * The proposer sends `Value(p[i])` to each validator number `i`.
//! * When validator `i` receives `Value(p[i])` from the proposer, it sends it on to everyone else
//! as `Echo(p[i])`.
//! * A validator that has received _N - f_ `Echo`s **or** _f + 1_ `Ready`s with root hash `h`,
//! sends `Ready(h)` to everyone.
//! * A node that has received _2 f + 1_ `Ready`s **and** _N - 2 f_ `Echo`s with root hash `h`
//! decodes and outputs the value, and then terminates.
//!
//! Only the first valid `Value` from the proposer, and the first valid `Echo` message from every
//! validator, is handled as above. Invalid messages (where the proof isn't correct), `Values`
//! received from other nodes, and any further `Value`s and `Echo`s are ignored, and the sender is
//! reported as faulty.
//!
//! In the `Valid(p[i])` messages, the proposer distributes the chunks of the value equally among
//! all validators, along with a proof to verify that all chunks are leaves of the same Merkle tree
//! with root hash `h`.
//!
//! An `Echo(p[i])` indicates that validator `i` has received its chunk of the value from
//! the proposer. Since `Echo`s contain the chunk, they are also used later on to reconstruct the
//! value when the algorithm completes: Every node that receives at least _N - 2 f_ valid `Echo`s
//! with root hash `h` can decode the value.
//!
//! A validator sends `Ready(h)` as soon as it knows that everyone will eventually be able to
//! decode the value with root hash `h`. Either of the two conditions in the third point above is
//! sufficient for that:
//! * If it has received _N - f_ `Echo`s with `h`, it knows that at least _N - 2 f_ **correct**
//! validators have multicast an `Echo` with `h`, and therefore everyone will
//! eventually receive at least _N - 2 f_ valid ones. So it knows that everyone will be able to
//! decode, and can send `Ready(h)`.
//! Moreover, since every correct validator only sends one kind of `Echo` message, there is no
//! danger of receiving _N - f_ `Echo`s with two different root hashes, so every correct validator
//! will only send one `Ready` message.
//! * Even without enough `Echo`s, if a validator receives _f + 1_ `Ready(h)` messages, it knows
//! that at least one **correct** validator has sent `Ready(h)`. It therefore also knows that
//! everyone will be able to decode eventually, and multicasts `Ready(h)` itself.
//!
//! Finally, if a node has received _2 f + 1_ `Ready(h)` messages, it knows that at least _f + 1_
//! **correct** validators have sent it. Thus, every remaining correct validator will eventually
//! receive _f + 1_, and multicast `Ready(h)` itself. Hence every node will receive
//! _N - f â‰¥ 2 f + 1_ `Ready(h)` messages.<br>
//! In addition, we know at this point that every node will eventually be able to decode, i.e.
//! receive _N - 2 f_ valid `Echo`s (since we know that at least one correct validator has sent
//! `Ready(h)`).<br>
//! In short: Once we satisfy the termination condition in the fourth point (we've received
//! _2 f + 1_ `Ready`s **and** _N - 2 f_ `Echo`s with root hash `h`), we know that
//! everyone else will eventually satisfy it, too. So at that point, we can output and terminate.
//!
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! In this example, we manually pass messages between instantiated nodes to simulate a network. The
//! network is composed of 7 nodes, and node 3 is the proposer. We use `u64` as network IDs, and
//! start by creating a common network info. Then we input a randomly generated payload into the
//! proposer and process all the resulting messages in a loop. For the purpose of simulation we
//! annotate each message with the node that produced it. For each output, we perform correctness
//! checks to verify that every node has output the same payload as we provided to the proposer
//! node, and that it did so exactly once.
//!
//! ```

//! use std::sync::Arc;

//!     // Our simulated network has seven nodes in total, node 3 is the proposer.
//!     const NUM_NODES: u64 = 7;
//!     const PROPOSER_ID: u64 = 3;
//!
//!     let mut rng = OsRng::new().expect("Could not initialize OS random number generator.");

//!     let netinfos = NetworkInfo::generate_map(0..NUM_NODES, &mut rng)
