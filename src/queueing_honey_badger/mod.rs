//! # Queueing Honey Badger
//!
//! This works exactly like Dynamic Honey Badger, but it has a transaction queue built in. Whenever
//! an epoch is output, it will automatically select a list of pending transactions and propose it
//! for the next one. The user can continuously add more pending transactions to the queue.
//!
//! If there are no pending transactions, no validators in the process of being added or
//! removed and not enough other nodes have proposed yet, no automatic proposal will be made: The
//! network then waits until at least _f + 1_ have any content for the next epoch.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! Queueing Honey Badger runs a Dynamic Honey Badger internally, and automatically inputs a list
//! of pending transactions as its contribution at the beginning of each epoch. These are selected
//! by making a random choice of _B / N_ out of the first _B_ entries in the queue, where _B_ is the
//! configurable `batch_size` parameter, and _N_ is the current number of validators.
//!
//! After each output, the transactions that made it into the new batch are removed from the queue.
//!
//! The random choice of transactions is made to reduce redundancy even if all validators have
//! roughly the same entries in their queues. By selecting a random fraction of the first _B_
//! entries, any two nodes will likely make almost disjoint contributions instead of proposing
//! the same transaction multiple times.
